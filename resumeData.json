Over a year of working in Android helped me develop some strong Java fundamentals, which I've further improved working with Spring at RBC. I've spent thousands of hours on the web basics (ES6, HTML5, SCSS), received training in Angular 7 and have also built sites using React & Node (like this one). In all pursuits I'm guided by SOLID principles, and keep a design patterns & code smells cheatsheet handy. Yes, I can build \"RESTful APIs\", and CI/CD is something I can't live without.",
